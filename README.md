# Modboi
  Modboi - The only moderator you'll ever need.

# Intro

Modboi was a project I started working on in 2017 that I never finished.
Recently, my best bot got hacked beyond repair (plus Discord banned the bot account), so I thought I'd revive this bot.
So that is the story of Modboi.

# Using this bot
So, you wanna use my bot, eh? Well first of all, there are a few steps to go through to do it.
> Modboi's prefix is customizable, and you can use the setprefix command to change the prefix.

## Steps

Step 1.
Go to [this](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/bots/572092327460601859 "Modboi") page, and click the 'Add to server' button.
> Also while you're there, please upvote the bot. It keeps me motivated to make more commands and features!

Step 2.
The bot will DM you with a first-time acknowledgements once it joins your guild.
You can customize the prefix how you like, and the bot will save it.
Check out [this](https://modboi.js.org/docs/command_list) list of commands (or run `m!help`) to see what all you can do.
